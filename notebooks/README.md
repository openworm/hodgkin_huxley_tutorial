## Jupyter notebooks for Hodgkin Huxley model

This directory contains a number of subfolders with interactive [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for running the HH model in your browser.

The most relevant one for most users is the notebook which uses the simple Python implementation of the HH model, and can be found [here](Python_HH_version/README.md).

This work was carried out as part of [Google Summer of Code 2022 by Rahul Sonkar](notebooks/GSoC_2022_Submission/GSoC_Documentation.md).
